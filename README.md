## About Me
I am a Computer Science student with a growing focus on **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**.  
I am particularly interested in understanding how reliable, well-tested software can improve user trust and support long-term technological goals, including the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

I am also exploring front-end fundamentals to better understand user-facing systems from a quality perspective.
