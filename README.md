## About Me
I am a Computer Science student with a strong inclination toward **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**.  
My interest lies in ensuring software reliability, usability, and consistency across user-facing and system-level components.

Alongside QA, I am developing an understanding of front-end technologies to better evaluate real-world user interactions.
